      The race is one of the oldest in the world still contested, celebrating
      its centenary in 2013. The race had modest beginnings as a production car
      race. Interrupted by the First World War, the race waited a decade for its
      second running before becoming a staple of the European calendar. In 1927
      it was part of the World Manufacturers' Championship; it was promoted to
      the European Championship in 1935 before the Spanish Civil War brought an
      end to racing. The race was successfully revived in 1967 and has been a
      regular part of the Formula One World Championship since 1968 at a variety
      of venues.
