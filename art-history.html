    <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      Bold, brash, colourful, distinctive, harmonious, varied and unique are
      just a few adjectives that come to mind when describing Barcelona
      architecture. Barcelona has successfully blended the old and the new in a
      way that makes this city simply breathtakingly beautiful. There is nothing
      more enjoyable than strolling around the streets of Barcelona and taking
      in the atmosphere that radiates out from the architecture.

      From gothic to Modernisme, this city has it all. Barcelona has its Gothic
      quarter which is very famous for its old infrastructure and architecture.
      However, it also has its modernisme buildings from Barcelona's
      Architecture Father Figure Antoni Gaudí. Gaudí created many of Barcelona's
      standing and boldly modern buildings that we know today.

    <h2>Art</h2>
    <p>
      My favorite painter in the world comes from Barcelona, Joan Miró.
      <img id="miro" src="images/Joan-Miró.jpg" alt="Painting of Joan Miró" />
      <br />Barcelona was known for its influence of Cubism as the time with
      Picasso and Miró, as well as others. A very open city to modern concepts,
      soon these painters became famous worldwide.
      <br />
      <br />
      Art history fans who want to explore Barcelona's art scene are going to
      love visiting The National Art Museum of Catalonia (MNAC). MNAC houses the
      most extensive collection of Catalan art from the 12th to the 20th
      Century, making it the perfect museum destination. Visitors will get to
      see a huge collection of medieval art, probably the best Romanesque
      collection in the world, several modernista works, and paintings by famous
      artists such as Salvador Dali and El Greco.
      <br />
      <br />
      After you're done viewing the museum's collection, climb up the castle to
      take in the stunning view of Barcelona.
      <br />
      <br />
      Most of the museums in Barcelona offer free entrance to visitors on every
      first Sunday of the month. So mark your calendars and reach early in the
      morning, during lunch time, or right before closing time to avoid crowds.
