    <h2>Port Olimpic</h2>
    <p>
      This is <strong> the</strong> place to be in summer! Here a string of
      upmarket lounge bars, such as CDLC, Shoko and Bestial attract a
      well-heeled cosmopolitan crowd to sip cocktails on their beach terraces
      before everyone moves indoors to go to the dancefloor.

      <br>
      Most of these places close at 3am unfortunately but the infamous Opium,
      plus Pacha and Catwalk keep going until 6am - of these Opium has the
      strongest claim to be the best club in the city, and is reliably packed.
    </p>
    <h2>El Born (a hidden jewel)</h2>
    <p>
      If you are looking for even more sophisticated place to experience the
      night life, you must visit El Born. You will find yourself surrounded with
      cafes and bars and all sorts of trendy attires. Miramelindo is one of such
      places, you will find all sorts of cocktails, but cava cocktail is a
      specialty here. Probe the backstreets further and you will find surprises
      such as Cat Bar in the hidden spots.
    </p>
    <h2>Las Ramblas</h2>
    <p>
      Most probably you will start from Las Ramblas if you are a newbie and you
      will find narrow streets just like a medieval old town. It is considered
      to be the busiest place in the daytime while by the time sun sets down,
      the streets will be crowded with artists giving their performances. That's
      time when tourist will start heading towards bars and clubs for drinks and
      dinner. The Kiosk La Cazalla and Boulevard Culture Club are few of the
      renowned places in Las Ramblas. When move down the street, you will find a
      proper irish setting, Wild Rover Irish Pub, in Barcelona. When you are
      looking for a more classy spot, go to Le Pop Cocktail Bar. You will be
      amazed by the creative cocktails and sparkling aperitivos this bar has to
      offer. The bar claims to have the best bartenders in the town which is
      undoubtedly true.
    </p>
    <h2 id="raval">Raval District (for techno lovers)</h2>
    <p>
      Raval is on the other side of the Las Ramblas where the streets are full
      with kids playing cricket or football. At the heart of this district,
      there hip bars such as Ambar which is continually filled with kids, lovely
      couples and lost souls. For a more glamourous crowd there is a cocktail
      bar nearby Marmalade. You can head to Nou de la Rambia to explore clubs
      such as Les Enfants (a Spanish disco), Moog (genuine electronic music/DJs)
      and Sala Apolo (small venue with Stereophonics and mid weeks parties like
      Nasty Mondays).
      <br />
      For a more relaxed time, get into Shenanigans Irish Pub for enjoying live
      music (mostly on Friday and Saturday) and pints. Hanging out with your
      friends in this authentic district can be even more fun when you visit
      Hipster's Bar Crawl. This will go miles to show you how the real night
      looks like.
    </p>
    <h2 id="gracia">Gracia</h2>
    <p>
      This district has got the same vibe as Raval and in fact locally
      dominated. Here you can find the real Catalan culture and aspiring artists
      with less foreigners. There are some exquisite bars located in this area
      such as La Cigale (known for good mojitos, Tapas and Cocktails) and La
      Fourmi (a great neighborhood spot with very good food and service).
